// ---------------------------------
// FEATURES of version 1 recfile:
//
// user can load/store the following:
//  - position, orientation, and goal location of any agent at any valid timestamp.
//  - bounding box of static obstacles.
//  - a list of camera views
//  - various global information such as num agents, num frames, total elapsed time of simulation, etc.
//
// internally, it stores 5 major sections:
//  - header
//  - list of camera views
//  - list of static obstacles
//  - all the playback data for each frame.
//  - frame table, giving basic info for each frame, including the location in the file of that particular frame
//
// ---------------------------------
// FEATURES of version 2 recfile:
//
//  - all the same features as version 1, but in-between the header and first frame exists an 
//    extra nul-terminated string that represents the test case filename (may be empty).
//
// ---------------------------------
