	/**
	 * @brief A class that provides basic state machine functionality.
	 *
	 * This class helps a user track states and transitions.  Integers are used to represent states;
	 * it is recommended you define your own enum data type to use instead of plain integers.
	 *
	 * To use this class, simply add the transitions you want to allow using addTransition().
	 * If setStartState() is not used to specify the starting state, then 0xffffffff will be used.
	 *
	 * Optionally, you can inherit and implement a StateMachineCallbackInterface, which allows your code
	 * to be called when any transitions occur, whether they are valid or unknown.  For example, it may be useful
	 * to handle erroneous transitions in StateMachineCallbackInterface::handleUnknownTransition().  Specify this
	 * callback during setup using the setCallback() function.
	 *
	 * After setting up, start the state machine using start(), which initializes the state machine
	 * to the start state, and throws an exception if any initialization functions are called.  start() itself
	 * cannot be called again until stop() was called. Once started, use transitionToState() to transition to a new state.
	 * This class will automatically check if the transition from currentState to newState is valid,
	 * and throws an exception if it was not valid.
	 *
	 * <h3> Notes </h3>
	 *  - All "valid" transitions must be defined by addTransition().
	 *    Invalid or unknown transitions will cause errors even if they were not specified by addErrorTransition().
	 *
	 *  - Internally, valid transitions are stored using a sparse 1-D lookup table (e.g. a std::set).
	 *    The implementation is not optimized for speed, but its performance should be decent and should scale
	 *    gracefully to a moderately large number of states and transitions.
	 *
	 *  - Transitions from a state to itself are treated just like any other pair of states.  In particular, you
	 *    must still define the transition normally or else it will cause an error.
	 *
	 * @todo
	 *  - make transitions effectively atomic by making it thread-safe.
