	/**
	 * @brief The primary interface for a module used by the SimulationEngine.
	 *
	 * %SteerLib provides several built-in modules, and can dynamically load additional plug-in modules. Modules can serve a variety of purposes,
	 * such as controlling initialization, providing steering AI or a component of AI, specialized animation, specialized rendering, and more.
	 *
	 *  If you want to create a plug-in module for the SimulationEngine:
	 *  -# Inherit and implement this interface.  All the functions below are optional except for initialization/cleanup functions.
	 *  -# Include SimulationPlugin.h and implement those two functions
	 *  -# Compile your code as a dynamic library, and place it in the appropriate modules directory where the SimulationEngine will search for modules.
	 *
	 * Additionally, the engine provides the SteerLib::EngineInterface to all modules, which can be used to access other
	 * modules, execute commands, control initialization, control the simulation, provide GUI controls, and more.
	 *
	 * The engine uses modules in the following way:
	 *  - At any time, even before calling init(), the engine may call getDependencies() and getConflicts().
	 *  - init() will be called once, before any other functions (except for getDependencies() and getConflicts()).
	 *  - When the module is being unloaded, finish() will be called before the (optional) destructor.
	 *  - During the lifetime of the module, the engine may run any number of simulations.  Each simulation has the following basic sequence:
	 *     -# For all modules, initializeSimulation() is called.  Modules that want to ask the engine to create agents should do so in this function.
	 *     -# For all modules, preprocessSimulation() is called.  Modules can assume that the initial conditions of all 
	 *        agents and obstacles are properly set up before this function is called.
	 *     -# For every update step:
	 *         -# For all modules, preprocessFrame() is called.
	 *         -# The engine then updates all agents and obstacles
	 *         -# For all modules, postprocessFrame() is called.
	 *     -# For all modules, postprocessSimulation() is called.  At this time, all agents and obstacles should remain allocated, so that modules can use them for post-processing.
	 *     -# For all modules, cleanupSimulation() is called.  Here, agents and obstacles should be deleted by the same module that created them.
	 *
	 * <h3>Notes</h3>
	 *  - The role of EngineInterface::createAgent() and ModuleInterface::createAgent() are slightly different:  Modules
	 *    that provide steering AI should implement ModuleInterface::createAgent(), allocating and returning the pointer of one agent,
	 *    and in turn, the engine would call ModuleInterface::createAgent() when appropriate.   On the other hand, a module that
	 *    wants to control the initialization of a simulation, for example, the TestCasePlayerModule or RecFilePlayerModule, would call
	 *    EngineInterface::createAgent().   EngineInterface::createAgent() then indirectly calls the appropriate module's
	 *    ModuleInterface::createAgent() function.
	 *
	 *  - No guarantees are made about the ordering of modules being loaded/initialized.
	 *
	 *
	 * @see
	 *   - SimulationPlugin.h
	 *   - SteerLib::EngineInterface provides a lot of functionality to modules.
	 *   - SteerLib::AgentInterface
