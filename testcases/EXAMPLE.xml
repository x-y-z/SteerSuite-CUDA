  This example test case is commented to describe (mostly) how to customize your own test 
  cases. Users are encouraged to create and share their own test cases.
  
  Test cases are XML using the "http://www.magix.ucla.edu/steerbench" namespace.  The schema
  for this namespace is provided in SteerSuite, in the file testcases/TestCaseSchema.xsd.  Be
  sure to validate your test case XML file against the schema to ensure there are no errors in
  the specification.

  To read test cases, use any standard XML parsing library (xerces, expat, tinyxml, etc.), or
  even easier, use the TestCaseReader C++ class provided in SteerLib.  The TestCaseReader class 
  hides all the XML parsing and test case initialization for you, and allows you to immediately 
  query the initial conditions for all agents, objects, and suggested camera views individually.

    <description>
      Users can add an optional description of your test case here.  It is often helpful
      to describe (in words) the goals that each agent has, and what types of 
      behaviors are being tested.
    </description>
    <passingCriteria> 
      Some example criteria:
      All agents must reach the goals within 10 seconds.
      All agents must have zero collisions that last longer than 0.1 seconds, using a threshold radius of 0.4.
      Agent A should not turn more than a total of 90 degrees.

  <!-- 
    The user can specify zero or more "suggested camera views".  The vertical
    field-of-view tag, <fovy>, is optional.  The purpose of suggested camera views
    is to provide reasonable camera configurations that give a good view of the 
    action that will take place in the test case.  This data is purely information,
    and is not considered part of the "test case initial conditions".

  <!-- 
    The test case is specified by any number of <obstacle>, <obstacleRegion>, <agent>,
    and <agentRegion> tags.  Agents have several properties, and a sequence of goals.
    Each goal tag has slightly different information; see the TestCaseSchema.xsd schema
    to see all possible options for specifying goals.

    that more options will be provided in the future.

  <!-- 
    For agents, <name> is optional.

    The goalSequence tag accepts many different types of goals.  Only two
    typical goals are shown here.  The agent is expected to accomplish all 
    goals in the order they are listed, and to move on once they accomplish
    their goal or have been trying for <timeDuration>, whichever comes first.
    For a complete list of the types of goals and their options, see the 
    TestCaseSchema.xsd file that describes the syntax of the test case XML 
    document.
    
    <name> can be used to identify an agent when telling another agent to seek
    a dynamic target.
    
    Note that there are no units enforced in the test case; however we recommend
    using meters for distance units and seconds for time units.  In these units,
    1.3 m/s is actually a common typical walking speed for pedestrians, and 0.5 is
    a radius of an agent (slightly larger radius than the real physical bounds of
    an average human.)

    Many randomly-placed agents can be defined in an <agentRegion> element.
    
    Any XML tag that expects an <x> <y> <z> tuple can be made random by replacing
    the <x>, <y>, <z> tags with the <random> tag.  In this example agent region, 
    all agents start off with a random direction.
