	/**
	 * @brief Gets a high resolution counter value for timing information.
	 *
	 * If you have problems compiling the code here, read the following details completely.
	 *
	 * This class will eventually use HPET, but it may be a while before that happens in all cases,
	 * because of limited support from operating systems.  HPET is the most recent recommended standard to get
	 * high-performance timing information, rather than reading the high-resolution TSC (Intel's time stamp 
	 * counter that counts # CPU cycles).  In some cases, the TSC may be invalid (e.g. cpu throttles
	 * frequency of the system, or clock skew across different cores), but HPET does not have these problems.
	 *
	 * Note that the return value is a 64-bit unsigned integer.  Most values returned by this counter
	 * will have important bits in the higher order bits, so these values cannot be truncated to 32 bits.
	 *
	 * For Windows, according to http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/sysinternals/mm-timer.mspx,
	 * the windows version of timing code transparently chooses between HPET and whatever other timing
	 * options available.
	 *
	 * For Linux, HPET is not widely supported yet.  The main problem is that many linux kernels will not
	 * have the feature compiled into the kernel even if the hardware exists.  Therefore, the Linux implementation
	 * does not use HPET directly.  Instead, the implementation uses Intel's platform-specific timer function, which
	 * will not work on other platforms.  If you need to support Linux on a non-intel machine, you can look at the code
	 * of this function and find two other options that are more platform-independent, but also perform worse.
	 *
	 * Because of this "migration" to HPET, there are three issues to be aware of, if the Intel TSC is used:
	 *  - Timing problems can occur if a process context switches to a different CPU core, which may
	 *    have a different counter value.
	 *  - Timing problems can also occur if any power management techniques are enabled that dynamically change CPU frequencies.
	 *
	 * These problems will not exist on newer hardware and newer versions of Windows, and we will update the Linux
	 * implementation when HPET becomes more widely supported.
