	/**
	 * @brief A platform-independent class that provides an easy way to use read-only memory mapping.
	 *
	 * Memory mapping is the technique of mapping a process's memory address space to a different resource,
	 * in this case, a file.  In many cases it can help performance significantly compared to
	 * the traditional file seek mechanism.
	 *
	 * This class is a platform-independent interface to use read-only memory mapping on files.
	 *
	 * To use this class, simply call open() with the file you want to map to memory;
	 * Then, #getBasePointer() can be used to get a pointer to the beginning of the file,
	 * and #getPointerAtOffset() can be used to get a pointer to any arbitrary location in the file.
	 * These pointers can be treated just like any other pointers until the file is closed.  Note
	 * that these pointers do not need to be freed or de-allocated, simply call #close() when you
	 * are done.
	 *
