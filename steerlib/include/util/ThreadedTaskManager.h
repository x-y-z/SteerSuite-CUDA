	 * @brief A simple platform-independent thread pool to run tasks.
	 *
	 * To use this class, simply instantiate it, specifying the number of threads in the thread pool.
	 * Then, as needed, add tasks to the queue using #addTask(), and if necessary, at any point, you can
	 * wait for all tasks to complete (#waitForAllTasksToComplete()).
	 *
	 * Of course, <b>you will need to make your tasks thread-safe!</b>
	 *
	 * <h3>Notes</h3>
	 * The throw() syntax, with nothing inside the parentheses, means that the function cannot throw exceptions.
	 *
	 * @todo
	 *  - This class has not been tested thoroughly yet, and may still need to be debugged.
	 *  - Use Windows Vista conditions
	 *
	 * @see
	 *  - Util::Mutex, a platform-independent wrapper for pthreads/win32 user-mode locks.
