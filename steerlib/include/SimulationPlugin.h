/// @file SimulationPlugin.h
/// @brief Defines the functionality needed to develop an external module plugin.
///
/// To create a module:
///  -# Create a separate project that is intended to compile as a dynamic library.
///  -# Inherit the SteerLib::ModuleInterface abstract class and implement its functionality.  Most of the functionality is 
///     optional, so the default empty implementations will be used if you do not implement them.
///  -# Implement createModule() and destroyModule() declared in SimulationPlugin.h.  These are used by the engine to
///     create/destroy an instance of your ModuleInterface.
///  -# Compile your dynamic library, and use the "-module <moduleName>" option when running <b>steersim</b>.
///  -# Optionally, you can also make a separate class that inherits SteerLib::AgentInterface to implement your own agents, and 
///     implement SteerLib::ModuleInterface::createAgent() and SteerLib::ModuleInterface::destroyAgent() to allocate and destory
///     these agents.
///  -# Enjoy!
