	 * @brief A wrapper class that uses the PerformanceProfiler to profile a function with only one line of code.
	 *
	 * This class can be used to profile a function using only one line of code.
	 * Simply instantiate the class where you would like to begin profiling the function. (This
	 * should not be a pointer that you allocate explicitly, but a direct instance that gets
	 * placed on the stack.)  When the function exits, this function's destructor gets called 
	 * automatically.  The constructor essentially calls PerformanceProfiler::start(),
	 * and the destructor essentially calls PerformanceProfiler::stop().
	 *
	 * An added advantage to using this wrapper is being less prone to error.  Without this, you 
	 * would need to place a call to PerformanceProfiler::stop() on each code path that returns.
	 * With this class, PerformanceProfiler::stop() is automatically invoked when the function 
	 * returns, no matter where the function returns from.
	 *
