This distribution of GLFW has the following modifications:

1. Examples, AmigaOS, and dos source files were removed
2. Export definition files and makefiles for win32 were removed
3. Most non-source files were removed
4. Added a Visual Studio 2008 project
5. Makefiles and compile.sh were modified to better fit our build process
6. removed the "unbundled mode" warning for mac osx

The reason for removing these components was to minimize the code size,
while keeping the necessary source files.  The original complete GLFW
(and good documentation) can be found at:  http://glfw.sourceforge.net/
